    <h2>What do I hope to get out of the class Human-Computer Interaction?</h2>
    <p>I hope to achieve a new level of understanding graphical and practical design. I can't wait to learn new techniques to create more interesting and appealing interfaces that users can use at ease. I would also like to further my abilities to make better applications and websites that people will find helpful, easy to use, and beautifully designed.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>What skills do i bring to the table?</h2>
    <p>I have experience working with languages such as Java, Javascript and libraries such as Angular, React, and Bootstrap, Html, CSS, PHP, MySQL, MongoDB, C, C++, and Python. I am currently in the process of learning and working with Android and IOS development. I have worked extensively in groups and with other individuals on projects for the past two years and hope to continue that this semester. I get along easily with teammates and will work tirelessly and non-stop till all work is done.</p>
